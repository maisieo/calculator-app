# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and includes a toggle switch to change the theme of the app.

## Note

Please note that since I wasn't using the Pro version of Front-End Mentor; I did this solely by eyesight and had no access to Figma. As a result, the design may not be an exact match to the original design.
